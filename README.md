# NLP-Document-Summary
Testing the capabilities of deep learning using a standard text (Alice in Wonderland). The Document Summary (control) notebook has a comprehensive description, walkthrough and result evaluation of the test. The Document Summary (experiment) notebook contains a mirror of the model ran on 'real world' data.

The scripts folder contain a number of important files, including the weights, so you may need to do some folder rigigging. The main point of this was to explore keras on a real use case, and as such the exprimental notebook is very sparse even though it should be easy to figure how to apply it to your own text documents (only use the control notebook for investigation).
